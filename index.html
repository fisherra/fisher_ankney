    Hey there, my name is Fisher Ankney and Iâ€™m a data scientist in training! Utilizing data to 
    make better decisions is my goal; technology and statistics are my tools. I'm currently studying
    data analysis in R as I apply to graduate programs in statistics.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-bottom:30px;">
    Previously, I studied geophysics at Colorado State University, where I formalized my 
    understanding of the scientific method and the basics of mathematical programming. Working at 
    the United States Geological Survey as a research assistant lead me further 
    down this rabbit hole of quantitative analysis.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; margin-bottom:30px;">
    I mainly use the tidyverse in R to explore and understand complex datasets. In graduate school 
    I plan to further my understanding of statistical methods and programming in python. To view some 
    of my work, check out the projects section of this website. Alternatively, you can browse my Github and 
    Kaggle accounts, the links are in the navigation.
