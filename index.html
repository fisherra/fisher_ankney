            Welcome to my personal site, here I share thoughts and stories from my time outdoors. I love fly fishing and upland bird hunting, but recreation opportunities in the mountain west are nearly endless and I can't help but dabble in big game, waterfowling, spin fishing, and more.

            I've linked my youtube channel and substack blog, these sites are where I share my adventures from the field and post long form written content. On the Sportsman's Journal I post field reports to track and learn from. The Bookshelf is where you can find my written thoughts and reviews on outdoor media.

            It doesn't matter if you're a well seasoned sportsman or if you're just curious, please feel free to read on and participate in the conversation by commenting or emailing me at fisherankeny@gmail.com. Thanks for visiting!
