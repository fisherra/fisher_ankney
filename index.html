            Welcome to my site, here I share my pictures, stories, videos, and more - all focused on the outdoors. I enjoy fly fishing and bird hunting above all else, but recreation opportunities here in the mountain west are nearly endless and I can't help but dabble in a lot of different things.

            I've linked my youtube channel and substack blog, these sites are where I share my filmed adventures and post longer form written content. In the Sportsman's Journal you can find my field reports where retell lessons or stories from my time in the field and I take note of the conditions and game bag for posterity. 
            The Bookshelf is where I summarize and review the books and articles I am reading.

            It doesn't matter if you're a well seasoned outdoorsman or if you're just a curious passerby, please feel free to read on and participate in the conversation by commenting or emailing me directly at fisherankney@gmail.com. Thanks for the visit and tight lines!
