            Welcome to my personal site, here I share my stories from the outdoors. My favorite pursuits are fly fishing and upland bird hunting, but opportunities in the mountain west are nearly endless and I can't help but dabble in big game hunting, waterfowling, spin fishing, and more.

            I've linked my youtube channel and substack blog, these sites are where I share my adventures from the field and post my long form written content. The Sportsman's Journal on this site is a photo-centric blog that I use to record my hunting and fishing trips for posterity. The Bookshelf is where you can find my written reviews of outdoor and outdoor adjacent media.
