    It's well known that data science is deeply rooted in the disciplines of statistics and computer science. Less 
    appreciated are the influences and underpinnings of the scientific method. At its core, data science conducts 
    an investigation through experimentation, hypothesis testing, and reason to better understand the natural world.
    In a sense, statistics and computer science are simply the tools of a data scientist to help them conduct an investigation.

    Undergraduate research in seismology and geodynamics introduced me querying and cleaning messy seismogram datasets of large proportions. I applied mathematical transformations, created geospatial models, and visualized datasets in creative ways to draw conclusions to present to the wider scientific community. I continued conduct similar research at the United States Geological Survey, where I maintained, cleaned, and 
    transforming large datasets, created statistical models, and visualized data in a quest for understanding.

    Wanting to become a better scientist, I've since devoted myself to studying how to best utilize the invaluable tools of statistical 
    analysis and computer programming. While I still identify with and enjoy earth science, somewhere on this journey
    I've fallen more in love with Data Science.

    I'm currently interested in internship or job opportunities pertaining to data science, software development,
    or computational statistics for the summer of 2019. Please feel free to download my

<p> R is my tool of choice for data analysis, statistics, and visualizations. I use tidyverse packages such as 
    <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/r4ds-purrr'>purrr</a>, 
    <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/r4ds-dplyr'>dplyr</a>, and 
    <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/r4ds-forcats'>forcats</a>, to underpin all of my work. Recently, I've completed projects focusing on
    <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/biodiversity'>exploratory data analysis</a>,
    <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/text-mining-the-hobbit'>text mining</a>,

<p>
    I enjoy using python for work that involves automation and looping, or connectivity with the web. I've worked
    through the resources <i>Learn Python the Hard Way</i>, <i>Think Python</i>, and 
    <i>Automate the Boring Stuff</i>. Currently, I'm working on including Python projects on this site,
    and learning the foundational Python data science packages such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn.

<p>
    MySQl allows me to interface Python and R with databases using the industry standard technology. Currently, I'm 
    learning MySQL through 
    <a href='https://www.udemy.com/sql-mysql-for-data-analytics-and-business-intelligence/#instructor-1?siteID=vedj0cWlu2Y-OQnD2pXn3pvUpDl4FHcQ_Q&LSNPUBID=vedj0cWlu2Y'>

<p> Besides these flagship technologies, I frequently use the version control software, git, in unison with 
    GitHub (@fisherra) to keep my projects backed up, organized, and replicable. I'm also experienced with SAS,
    bash scripting, and web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, SASS, Jekyll, and basic JavaScript.

<strong>Graduate Teaching Assistant, 2018 - 2020</strong>

<p>As a Graduate Teaching Assistant, I communicate technical information to an often-non-technical audience,
   give thorough presentation weekly, and cultivate a strong knowledge base in the fundamentals of statistics.

<strong>Science Technician, 2013 - 2017</strong>

<p>
    At the USGS, I used R and industry specific statistical software to model and visualize statistical
    phenomena between tree-rings, climate, and hydrogeology daily. I Conducted applied research on riparian
    ecosystems throughout the western United States, including experiment design and data collection. Finally, 
    I followed through with investigations until completion by publishing statistical models, tables, figures, 
    experiment methodology, and conclusions in two peer-reviewed scientific articles (second author).

<strong>Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, 2014 - 2016</strong>

<p>
    As an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant I was the unaccompanied instructor to a total of six sections 
    of the University's core-curriculum Introduction to Geology Laboratory course. As instructor, I maintained
    a positive, effective learning environment through the application of scientific teaching, strong communication skills,
    and a broad knowledge of geosciences.
