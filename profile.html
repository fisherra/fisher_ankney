        My journey has given me foundational experience in using data to derive insight. My Bachelor’s education,
        concentrating in geophysics, introduced me to the scientific method, as well as querying and cleaning large and messy
        data sets. I applied mathematical transformations, created geospatial models, and visualized datasets in creative ways
        to draw conclusions to present to the wider scientific community. 
    </p>

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        After graduating with my Bachelor's, I continued conducting research and growing my skillset the United States Geological Survey. 
        My work involved maintaining, cleaning, and transforming large datasets. I created statistical models, and continued to 
        visualized data to better understanding the natural world.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        Wanting to become a better scientist, I've since devoted myself to studying how to best utilize the invaluable tools of
        statistics and programming. While I still identify with and enjoy the earth sciences, somewhere along the line, I have 
        broadened my scope to include a breadth of data-centric problems.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        I am currently in the second semester of my M.S. in Statistics at Oklahoma State University. While teaching elementary statistics
        to undergraduate students, I’m completing my coursework and engaging in applied statistical research. 
    </p>


    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        I'm complimenting my formal education with a variety of skills in my spare time. I’m studying relational database management
        systems, machine learning algorithms, interactive visualization software, and much more. 
    </p> 

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
            I'm currently interested in internship or job opportunities pertaining to data science, business intelligence,
            or analytics for the summer of 2019. Please feel free to download my
