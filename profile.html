<p> 
    I'm currently earning my Master's degree in Statistics ar Oklahoma State University. I'm focusing on building a strong
    foundation of traditional statistical analysis techniques by taking courses in Linear Models, Multivariate Analysis, and
    Bayesian Analysis. By utilizing the rich and quickly developing data science ecosystems of the R and Python languages along with
    traditional SAS programming, I'm able to solve a breadth of statistical computing problems. 
<br><br>
    I'm looking for internship opportunities for the Summer of 2019 that involve complex statistical computing problems. Please feel
    free to contact me at fisherankney@gmail.com.
