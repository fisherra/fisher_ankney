<p> 
    I'm currently earning my Master's degree in Statistics at Oklahoma State University. By taking courses in linear modeling, Bayesian
    analysis, and multivariate methods, I'm building a strong foundation of applied and theoretical statistics. Applying these techniques to the real world with 
    the help of computational technologies like R, Python, SAS, and others, allow me to a tackle a wide range of complex analytical problems. 
<br>
<br>
    I'm looking for internship or job opportunities that are heavily involved in statistical computing for the Summer of 2019. Please feel free to contact me at fisherankney@gmail.com.

<strong> M.S. Statistics, 2018 - 2020</strong>
<p> In this thesis-based masterâ€™s program, I'm learning advanced statistical analysis techniques and theories in over 30 credits of 
    graduate level coursework. While studying, I've continued my collaboration with the United States Geological Survey on dendrochronological
    research. Finally, I'm the primary instructor of Elementary Statistics (STAT 2013) to over 70 undergraduate students each semester.

<strong> B.S. Geology, 2012 - 2016 </strong>
<p> Concentrating in Geophysics, I earned a 3.64 GPA and graduated as the Geology Department's Honor Senior in May of 2016. My 
    undergraduate was heavily focused in mathematics and computer science, I took graduate level coursework and completed research
    in seismology and geodynamics. I taught several sections of the Introduction to Geology Laboratory class during my junior and 
    senior year.

<p> As my analytical tool of choice, R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. I was first introduced
    to R at the United States Geological Survey in 2014 to conduct research in dendrochronology. I typically use the R Studio IDE; 
    some of my favorite R packages include the tidyverse collection, Rmd, Knitr, plotly, gganimate, rsta, mcmc, caret, and mlr.

<p>Python's growing data science ecosystem is a joy to use, especially in the realm of machine learning. I've been programming in Python
    since my undergraduate days in 2014. I started by using python to assist in my seismology research, but quickly began to adapt 
    analytical libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, and SciPy.

<p>
    SAS, or the Statistical Analysis System used to be the go-to software for data analysis. These days many projects are being
    completed in open source software like R and Python. However, there are billions of lines of legacy code written in SAS that
    won't be going away any time soon. That's why I've elected to study for the SAS Certified Base Programmer for SAS 9 Global 
    Certificate.

<p> I've found that using the version control technologies Git and GitHub allow me to keep my projects orderly and reproducible. 
    When I'm downloading or cleaning data files, shell commands automate these processes in the terminal often saving me hours of
    repetitive clicking. Finally, my familiarity with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, SASS, Jekyll, and Django allow 
    me to share my projects with the world on this very site.
