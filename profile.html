        Originally from a small town in Northern Michigan, I moved to Colorado just a few days after graduating from high school. 
        I fully enjoyed my time in the mountains while studying Geophysics at Colorado State University.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        Upon graduation from CSU in 2016, I transitioned into working full time at the United States 
        Geological Survey doing scientific data analysis in R. In May of 2017 I left the USGS to begin an around-the-world backpacking trip that would take me to 20 different countries.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        While I retain my love for the mountains and travelling, I'm now fully committed to becoming an outstanding data scientist. 
        I'm currently completing my master's in Statistics at Oklahoma State University.
