<p> 
    I'm a graduate student of statistics at The Oklahoma State University. My studies are primarly focused on bulding and utilizing
    statistical data modeling tools. I mainly use R's rich statistical analysis ecosystem, but I'm also very familiar
    with python. If your interested in viewing my some of work, check out my blog, github repository, or kaggle account.
