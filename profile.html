        Originally from a small town in Northern Michigan, I moved west a few days after graduating from high school.
        I enjoy spending as much time as I can in the mountains - fishing, hunting, hiking, skiing and camping. In the between, I've managed
        to collect a few degrees and jump start an awesome career in tech.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        I attended Colorado State University to earn my Bachelors in Geophysics - studying geology and living in the
        Rocky Mountains make for a great undergraduate experience! On graduation in 2016, I spent two years working
        as a data analyst for the United States Geological Survey, before taking off on an 8 month long backpacking trip around
        Asia, Europe and Central America.

        Returning to the US, I complete my Master's in Statistics and quickly took my next job developing a forecasting
        algorith for a small startup in May of 2020. Very naturally I made the transition to product management and
        signed on with my current employer, Oracle.

        I am now excited to dive into the world of programmatic advertising as I continue to build my skills
        in the management and development of data-drive products.
