Nine months! Three seasons! Two-hundred and seventy days of data science! 

Early on, I set a goal for myself to periodically report my data science progress and put forward concrete plans for the near future in *Data Science Updates* on my blog. This is my third such update, and I'm happy to say that I’ve been productive in the last three months, and I plan on taking it to the next level in the next three.

My second update can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ds-update-2) and my first update can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/ds-update).


### The Last 3 Months

To keep myself accountable, I set out these 5 goals in the previous update: 

- Move to Stillwater Oklahoma and begin M.S. Statistics Program
- On track to earn A's in each of my classes
- Exceed expectations in GTA work and research
- Read *Introduction to Statistics*
- Complete 5 more blog posts

<br>

#### Move to Stillwater, Oklahoma

*Complete*

I moved to Stillwater, Oklahoma on August 1st, and have been living here for two whole months! While it's extremely hot here, and very flat, I'm doing alright. There's a Starbucks, and a Qdoba, so I think I'll be able to manage. 

<br>

#### On Track to Earn the A

*Complete*

I'm currently earning a 100% in my Statistics for Experimenters I course, a 93% in my SAS course, and a 98% in my Probability Theory course. I do have a Probability Theory exam coming up which I'm studying for, but I think I'll do just fine. 

<br>

#### Exceed Expectations in GTA and Research

*Complete*

There isn't that much to say here. GTA duties include tutoring in the Statistics-help room for 20 hours a week. Potential research includes creating an R package for a specific statistical analysis technique. 

<br> 

#### Read Introduction to Statistics

*Fail*

I got about 150 pages into this book and found it was a bit elementary for me. I'm ok with not finishing this goal.

<br>

#### Complete 5 Blog Posts

*Complete*

I'm very happy to report that I've complete 5 blog posts and I’m quite proud of them. My first post of the quarter, [Casino Games - Roulette]({{ site.baseurl }}/roulette-analysis) is my longest analysis yet. I've finally finished my Unpacking the Tidyverse series, the [forcats]({{site.baseurl}}/forcats) and [purrr]({{ site.baseurl }}/purrr) posts were especially fun to create. Finally, [Casino Games - Dice]({[site.baseurl}}/roll-the-dice) was a short post that I quickly put together to spell out some ideas related to probability. It came together in less than 3 hours and I'm very happy with the finished product. 

Overall, I've accomplished a tremendous amount in the last 3 months, especially considering I spent most of July in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks.

<br> 

### The Next Three Months 

Setting goals is always my favorite part of ...well everything. In the next three months, I hope to accomplish many things. 

<br> 

#### Earn A's in all my Courses

While a part of me knows that GPA no longer matters, I feel the need to start off my degree with a strong GPA. Anything below a B can get you kicked out of my program, and I very much plan on earning my Master's degree. Perhaps next semester I will relax a bit and aim for high B's, opting to spend my time on programming and other endeavors.. but for now, it's A's. 

<br> 

#### Earn the SAS Base Programmer Certificate

I dislike SAS. I dislike SAS a lot. But I've completed a full-length graduate course on the software, and It requires I take the base certification to earn an A in the course. I figure I might as well pass the exam if I'm forced to take it. 

<br> 

##### Complete 2 Blog Posts

That's right, only two. I'm shifting my focus away from short EDA projects and package tutorials for this quarter. I plan on finishing up my Casino Games series by creating ambitious posts on card games and slot machines in R.

#### Update Fisherankney.com

As always, I wish to improve my website / portfolio. Small, iterative improvements make a big difference over time. This quarter, I hope to create a resource review section, where I'll do just what the title suggests. I've been burning through a lot of Data Science resources, and I think it would be beneficial to myself and others if I compiled, summarized, and rated the resources I've used. 

<br> 

#### Complete and Review 6 Coding Resources

The resources are - 

- Hands on Programming with R by Garrett Grolemund
- Statistics in R by by Sudha Purohit
- R in Action, Second Edition by Robert Kabacoff
- Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw
- Think Python By Allen B. Downey
- SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (Udemy Course)

<br> 

An ambitious quarter, but I think I'm up to the challenge. 

Until next time, <br>
\- Fisher
