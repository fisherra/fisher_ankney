## Union = Append

`UNION` is basically SQL's way to append data from one table to another. `UNION` is placed between two `SELECT` statements that return the same type and number of columns. 

Generic example:

```
SELECT column_1
  FROM table_1 
UNION
SELECT column_2
  FROM table_2
```

<br>

As long as column_1 and column_2 are of the same data type (i.e. integers), you'll be given a singular column that contains unique entries from both of the columns, stacked upon each other.

`UNION ALL` will return duplicates in this list. 

The following example returns all of the cities and countries in which stores and customers are located.

```
SELECT city, country 
  FROM stores
UNION
SELECT city, country,
  FROM customers
```

<br>

You can think of unions as if you're stacking data sources on top of one another, as opposed to joins where you're combining data sources in a horizontal fashion.

<br>

That's all for now!
