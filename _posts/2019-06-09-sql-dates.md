## Date Types

<br>

- DATE - YYYY-MM-DD
- DATETIME - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- TIMESTAMP - YYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
- YEAR - YYYY or YY

<br>

Just match it like a string! Also, don't attempt to match a datetime or timestamp to just its date. It won't work.

```
SELECT * 
  FROM dates
  WHERE order_date = '2019-06-10'
```

<br>

# In and Between

If you're not looking to match a specific date, but several or even a range of dates, In and Between will be useful. In precedes a list of dates within parenthesis, and between allows you to list two dates and will find everything *between* them. These two operators aren't only for dates, they can be used on all of the other data types too!

```
SELECT order_year
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_year IN ('2018', '2008', '1998')
```

<br>

```
SELECT order_year
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_year BETWEEN '2010' and '2015' 
```

<br>

That's all for now!
