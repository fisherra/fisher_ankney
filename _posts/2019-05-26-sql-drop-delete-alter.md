## Deleting Databases

Deleting databases is done using the GUI after entering authentication and confirming your selection. 

<br> 

## Deleting Tables

Another simple command, use the `DROP` function to delete a table. 

```
DROP TABLE example_table;
```

<br> 

## Deleting Columns

First you must specify the table you're altering, then the row you wish to drop.

```
ALTER TABLE example_table_2
  DROP COLUMN email;
```

<br> 

## Deleting Rows

You can delete a single row by referencing a primary key, or a number of rows using logic with the where clause. 

Deleting a hypothetical single row:

```
DELETE FROM example_table
  WHERE 
    emp_no = 99903;
```

<br> 

Deleting many hypothetical rows:
```
DELETE FROM example_table
  WHERE
    start_date <= '2015-01-01'
```

<br> 

## Deleting Values

If you want to replace a value with null (or another value for that matter), use the `UPDATE` function. In this example, I replace all zeros with NULL. 

```
UPDATE
  example_table
SET
  value = NULL 
WHERE
  value = 0
```

<br>

That's all for now!
