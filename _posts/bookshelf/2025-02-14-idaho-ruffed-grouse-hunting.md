A collection of almost 3 dozen short stories from over 20 years - Idaho Ruffed Grouse Hunting by Andrew Waymont is a fun and relatable read that reminds me why there is always a corner of my mind that is dedicated to counting down the days until the calendar reads September 1st. 

A lawyer from Idaho Falls, Wayment spends much of the book recalling his most memorable and meaningful pursuits from behind his two Brittanys, Misty and Sunny. The book is structured into short chapters that can be read and enjoyed independently, but they indeed build on each other to give some impression of a greater arch in the life of a dedicated grouse hunter. 

The author remains very focused on the ruffed grouse, the pursuit of him, and the environment in which this pursuit happens. It is extremely refreshing to read a narration on the essence of the hunt in such a real and relatable way. You are not sold on fancy lodges and private, uppity preserve hunts. You are not whisked away on an epic and expensive once in a lifetime trip to the land of endless flushes. You are not pressured to buy a five-figure custom italian side by side. I welcome this departure from the typical Shooting Sportsman articles which are cluttered with Krieghoff ads and preserve sponsorships, and the Joe Rogan interviews with “bowhunting billionaires” that I am used to consuming. 

My favorite chapters describe Wayment’s most coveted coverts (hunting spots), his good hearted but overly enthusiastic bird dogs, and his many missed shot opportunities on ‘ol ruff. In some chapters the author recounts his misadventures that result in expensive calls for the tow truck and even more expensive calls for the ambulance. 

Above all, in Idaho Ruffed Grouse Hunting Wayment communicates his gratitude and reverence for the pursuit of ruffed grouse. Wayment successfully relays that to some, wingshooting is much more than a sport or hobby, it is a most meaningful and essential part of a life well lived. 

*“The older I get the quicker time flies, nowhere is the saying ‘all good things must come to an end’ more true than in grouse hunting. The trick is to soak it up, to enjoy every second while it lasts and to be grateful for every moment we spend with our dogs in the grouse woods.”*
