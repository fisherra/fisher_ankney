Chuck Johnson’s book made its way to me as required reading when I put my deposit down for my first German Wirehaired Pointer puppy at Bone Point Kennels last month. The majority of this 225 page primer is dedicated to reinforce in the the reader **how to not screw up your dog in his first year.** Less than a quarter of the book is dedicated to general training, about three quarters to upland bird training - the majority of this segment details leading up to and including the first upland bird first season and the minority details finishing the bird dog in the second season and beyond - and about a quarter of the book is dedicated to waterfowl training. 

While I’ve read the book cover to cover, I plan to take Johnson’s advice and re-read each relevant sections when I am in the thick of training with my new dog this summer. The author details how to properly socialize your puppy in the critical first 16 weeks, including step by step instructions on gun, water, and bird introductions. The main thesis is to give the puppy his first year in the field. In the first of bird training and hunting, the dog can do no wrong and should not be corrected or reigned in, your only goal is get the dog on as many birds as possible and to devlop their love and enthusiasm for hunting. 

*“In the beginning, your main goal is to train your dog, not to fill your game bag. You will be able to enjoy many days of full game bags and wonderful dog work if you take the time to develop your dog into the best he can be.”*

After reading *Training the Versatile Hunting Dog* I feel confident that I understand and can follow this ethos and that I have detailed instructions on how to not screw up my puppy in their frist year. I feel less confident that I have all that I need for whoa training, force fetch, steadiness, and advanced water retrieving skills. While these topics are detailed in the book I still plan on joining NAVHDA to work through this in person in my dog’s second year.

Overall, I found this book to be a fun and instructional read. I especially enjoyed the section chronicling one of the author’s puppies, Camas, development through his first year. I will try to replicate this with my GWP puppy this year by keeping and posting a video journal of puppy progress to my youtube. This will be a great keepsake and help me stay regimented and honest with my dog training. If anything, Johnson’s book has leveled my first year expectations and has gotten me even more excited at the prospect of picking up my new pup this summer.
