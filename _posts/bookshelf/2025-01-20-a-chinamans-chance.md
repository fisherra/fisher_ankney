I found *A Chinaman’s Chance* in a used book store while browsing the local history section. 
Originally a PhD thesis that was later edited to be more palatable for the armchair historian, this book is well cited and retains an academic tone. In about 200 pages we dive deep into the experiences of early Chinese immigrants to the Boise Basin area of Idaho during the height of its mining boom - from 1864 to 1900. 

Throughout this book, the author challenges traditional narratives of Chinese exploitation and victimhood in the 19th century American frontier using well cited primary sources. The Chinese of Boise Basin, an area which encompasses about 200 miles roughly centered on Idaho City, apparently lived prosperous and healthy lives that far exceeded the standard of living in their homeland and even the standards across most of the U.S. at that time.

The everyday experience of Boise Basin Chinese is presented holistically - sometimes they were the victims of frontier violence, and other times the perpetrators. This area of the Rocky Mountains is argued to have among the most harmonious and fair race relations in the country (and also world) at the time. While Anti-Chinese attitudes ebbed and flowed across the country (San Francisco riot of 1877, Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Rock Springs massacre of 1885) Boise Basin was largely unaffected by these sentiments. In fact, Utah polygamists faced much harsher social and legislative opposition in Idaho at this time. 

The book gives a detailed account of working and living conditions, occupations, cultural events, immigration rates, mining claims, and more, but I found the trials and triumphs of the individual miners to be much more memorable. While reading about the numerous shootouts, arsons and kidnappings, I couldn’t help but think that the happenings in Idaho City - which in 1865 was the most populous in the American Northwest and fully one-third Chinese - would make for an excellent HBO drama.  

I would recommend this read for anyone that is interested in local Idaho history, frontier life, or the experiences of early Asian Americans. It is very focused and academic read, but enjoyable nonetheless.
