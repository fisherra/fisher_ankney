exc: "I packed this unusually warm month full of new experiences. From my first ever chukar hunts to the last ducks of the 2024/5 season, it was a jam packed month. I even found some gold!"

## January 1, Scouting

**Conditions:** Early afternoon, there has been recent heavy snow with about a foot on the ground. Cloud cover and light snow continues, temperature is around 30 degrees.  

**Notes**: I spent the majority of New Year’s Day making my way to a rumored hot spring way back in the mountains - a mission that amounted to three hours of driving - one way - thanks to the foot of fresh snow. 
The same snow, however, gave cause to the elusive chukar to let down his guard and hangout nearer the road. The birds obviously popped to the naked eye against the fresh white backdrop. I counted over 100 birds in the time I wasn’t white knuckle focused on the road. I got out to flush 3 separate coveys with my 20ga, killing none but slipping and falling several times.

I found the bird's tracks extremely distinctive in the fresh snow. This was my first time seeing a wild chukar up close! It confirmed to me that the birds are here in huntable numbers.

## January 4, First Chukar

**Conditions:** Noon, the previous week's snow has mostly melted, only clinging to the top third of the mountain. There is no wind and it is partially cloudy at a comfortable 40 degrees. 

**Notes:** I spent the first outing on a trail and then traversing back behind the main set of slopes with no success. I spent my second outing hiking up a third of the main slope's height to find an old overgrown access road. After half an hour of walking this road, I busted a covey of chukar in a fold in the mountain, missing all. I was following up on where I saw a trio land (back across the ravine, a 30 minute hike away) when I flushed an unexpected single. The bird came up only 5 yards ahead of me and swung to my right when I downed him at sabout 5 o'clock and 20 yards. Unfortunately I lost a different bird later on an overhead passing shot, the birds were spooked by a helicopter and about 50 flew down the mountain from above.

In total I saw about 150 birds, I flushed or re-flushed about 4 dozen, killed two, and claimed one.

## January 11 & 12, A Pair with Chase

**Conditions:** Early afternoon with some clouds, no wind and temperatures in the low thirties. A light snow covers the top third of the mountain. 

**Notes:** Unhappy with being unable to retrieve my downed chukar from last weekend, I borrow my dad’s Brittany named Chase and got out for a short hunt on both Saturday and Sunday. We amateurishly wild flushed and bumped about 50 birds over the two days and somehow even manage to collect two for the game bag. 

I put together [this short video](https://youtu.be/OpHBmLaFFp4) to document the experience.

## January 18, Last Chukar and Gold!

**Conditions:** Morning hunt a little further out with no wind and temperatures in the mid twenties. A light snow covers the top third of the mountain. 

**Notes:** On this, my last hunt of the 2024 season, Chase and I started by making our initial ascent to the ridgeline. We climb and traverse about an hour without any sign until we see a few old tracks in hardened snow. Chase bumps a pair of chukar about 50 yards out as we sidehill, they soar to the other side of the canyon without a shot. Walking uphill about 30 minutes later I get a passing shot on a second pair. I stone one and Chase makes the retrieve. No other birds are seen despite numerous tracks and another hour and a half hunting. 

After the Chukar hunt, I meet my mom who has been rockhounding down by the truck - we try our luck panning for gold in a small runoff creek and the main river.. We strike it rich with about 30 flakes from a total of around 15 pans. 

This is my last hunt of the 2024/5 season and I am very happy to have bagged 4 chukar in total this month. I think that is pretty good for a pair of amateurs! I am ecstatic to have a bird dog of my own next year to give chase to these devil birds.
