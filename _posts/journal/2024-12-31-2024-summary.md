Another great year in the books, this year I focused my efforts mostly on fly fishing for trout, the same many previous. In 2024 I succeeded in establishing a rhythm of what water to fish and when, based on hatches and flow conditions. I plan to iterate on this blueprint in the 2025  season. 

In January and February I joined my buddy Andreas on the lower Salmon River to chase steelhead for the first time. Over three separate day trips I caugth 4 steelhead, all about 24 to 28 inches in length. Two of the fish were wild (which I found to be incredible) and two were hatcheries (which I found to be delicious).

In early spring, I found myself on the Madison for a four day weekend, running into a [little bit more snow than I anticipated](https://youtu.be/PaSYefJB2rI). Just before runoff started I had regular success on the local Boise River by euro nymphing and occasionally running into some Blue Wing Olive hatches. check out [my most popular Youtube video this year](https://youtu.be/k2VlinuJ0-g)that recounts one fantastic March day on the Boise.

Unfortunately the Owyhee River was overwhelmed with excessive runoff and did not fish well at all this year. This would usually be my go to in that April and May lull. Instead, I decided to lighten my pockets by purchasing my very first drift boat, a never before floated 2022 Hyde Low Profile XL.

On my birthday in Early June I caught my first brown drake hatch on fabled Silver Creek. The number of bugs and rises lived up to the hype, even if it was combat fishing for the first hour or so. Unfortunately I don’t have photo evidence of the few solid but not excessively big brown trout I caught that night, I was locked in fishing for the big one that never quiet panned out. 

Later in June I would throw salmon flies from a boat for the first time, in the process I broke two of my fly rods, also for the first time. It was a greaet experience, managed to land some respectable fish including a beautiful bull trout on the fourth of July.

July was by far my favorite month for fishing this year, just as it was last year. Post-runoff is my favorite time to get into the mountains and chase cutthroat on freestone rivers. Nothing beats the painfully slow rise of a big cutty for a Chubby Chernobyl way out in the back country.

In late summer, my dad finally made the move out to Idaho, and while I guided him to some great trout fishing, we also added two new species to the 2024 net.

In the fall we traded out our rods for shotguns, always a bittersweet moment  We had notable success waterfowling - even though we were rather limited by our gear, my parents and I were able to post up two three-man-limits this year. A feat that is not easily achieved hunting exclusively from the bank with no more than two dozen decoys, no dog, and no boat other than a perpetually sinking discount store kayak. I give a lot of credit to my mom with her new Beretta A300 autoloader that really improved her efficacy.

Otherwise we had a few good hunts, and a few poor hunts depending on how responsive the duck were feeling that day. Unfortunately we neglected chasing upland birds much this year, only counting about half a dozen grouse, a dozen quail, and four or five pheasants. I also ate tag soup for elk and mule deer, only getting up to my unit for one three day weekend this year. 

All in all 2024 was a great year, I am happy to have my parents join me out in here in Idaho and I am looking forward to 2025. This next year I would like add in some ice fishing for perch and lake trout and I expect I will spend a substantial amount of time training my new bird dog in the late summer and all fall.

Until next time,
