## March 8, Nymphing on the South Fork 

**Conditions:** standard bluebird day, little to no wind with a high in the upper thirties. We fished from about noon to 5pm.  

**Notes**: Dad and I got the itch to get out and fly fish for the first time in many weeks, it was warmer than usual but still a bit cold to be wading around in the water all day. 

Fishing mostly zebra midges from both traditional and European nymphing setups, dad pulled in half a dozen whitefish and a few nice rainbows from two different slow runs. My count was two rainbows and one bull trout (in March!) from deeper pools. The bull trout was actually caught on a rubber legs under an indicator, maybe he thought it was a funky bait fish, who knows. Overall not too bad of a day for early March on the SFB.
