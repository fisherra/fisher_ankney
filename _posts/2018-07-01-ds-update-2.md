Six months have passed since I've decided to dive into the world of data science. 

Second quarterly update on my data science progression. During this time I've been on a roadtrip throughout the western United States, including 12 national parks across 9 states. Outdoors, refuel myself. 

My previous update found here <here>. 

To keep motivated and accountable on this path, I'm recording a quarterly update to summarize what I've accomplished in the last three months and what I hope to accomplish in the next three. 

In the previous update i set out these goals - 

enroll in a statistics graduate program that will start this fall

completely work through intro stat learn

completely work through intro to statistics

10 more blog posts

update blog layout


Unfortunately, I failed most of these goals; here's what was accomplished. 

### Enrolled in M.S. Statistics Program

The most important goal, to completion. Oklahoma State University, full tuition waiver, generous stipened. TA introduction to buisness statistics course all four semesters. I move to Stillwater Oklahoma August 1st, TA course starts August 6th. 

A big win in my book.

### Two Blog Posts

### The Next Three Months 

While I've failed in some aspects the past three months, I'm confident to succeed in the next three.

until next time, <br>
