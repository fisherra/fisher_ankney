There are a lot of great blog posts and online tutorials covering a wide
range of data science topics online. Whether you're struggling to create
your first ggplot, or if you're pursueing the latest machine learning
techniques in R, you'll probably find hundreds of resources in our great
community. However, there is one topic that I think is under
represented, and that topic is project management.

Proper project management might sound trivial at first, but it's
essential to keeping your projects organized, reproducable, and secure.
Just a few moments of forethought and effort can save you hours of pain
and regret later. Check out these tips and habits that I've found keep
my projects in tip-top shape.

#### Creating a Project

The very first thing I do when I'm starting a data science project is to
create a project folder. Anything and everything associated with your
new project will live in this local project folder, so give it a good
name. I always use
[snake\_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) while working
with programming projects. snake\_case creates consistency and makes
navigating files in the terminal a breeze. Once I've created te project
folder I'll change my working directory to the project folder and create
a text document. In this text document, I write a small project
overview, putting my project ideas into words and goals. Once my project
has a name and direction, I initiate a git repository to start tracking
my progress.

#### Version Control

If this comic accurately describes you, you're probably not using
version control. Version control is the task of keeping a software
system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized.
Git is the one true diety in the world of version control.

Creating git repositories and interfacing with Github is an entire
series of blog posts by itself. For the purposes of this post I'll just
point you to Data Camp's [Introduction to Git for Data
Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science).
It's a free, high-quality, four-hour course that teaches you everything
you need to know about git. While you're there, check out [Introduction
to Shell for Data
Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science)
as well.

#### Data Source

Once your git repository is up and running, it's time to gather data! If
you're working on a professional project you'll probably gather data
from an SQL server or network database. If you're working on a personal
project, you have a near infinite number of choices for gathering data.
Check out some this
[DataQuest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/)
article on where to find some interesting datasets.

Once you've downloaded the data you would like to work with, you should
never overwrite this original dataset. If you do want to make changes to
your data, and you likely will, you should save the newer versions as
such. Commonly, I'll change datasets into .csv or .txt files and change
the encoding to UTF-8 among other things. If you're changing anything
within the data, such as setting blank values to N/A, make these changes
using R scripts and save the scripts for posterity. I've written a [blog
post](link) on effectively importing data into r using the readr
library.

#### Project Structure

Where do the datasets go? Where should the plots and scripts and
markdown documents go? Instead of throwing all your files into the
project folder and calling it good, try to keep your project structured
with sub-folders. My projects always end up looking something like this:

turtle\_analysis/ <br  /> 
|- input/ <br  /> 
|--- about\_turtles.txt
<br  /> 
|--- ocean\_temp.csv <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_sizes.csv <br  /> 
| <br  /> 
|- scripts/ <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_eda.Rmd <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_height\_plot.R <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_width\_plot.R <br  /> 
| <br  /> 
|- output/ <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_height.png <br  /> 
|--- turtle\_width.png <br  /> 
| <br  /> 
|- final\_analysis.Rmd <br  /> 
|- final\_analysis.html <br  /> 
|- final\_analysis.md <br  />
|- README.md <br  />

I use three main folders inside a project folder, input, scripts, and
output. input/ is where all the datasets related to your project reside.
Remember, even if you don't use the original, unaltered dataset, it's
still best to keep a copy of it. The scripts/ folder is where all your
programming goes. If you alter the dataset in any way, do it with a
script, and save that script! If you create any plot, table, or
calculation that may be useful, save the .R or .py file in in scripts/.
Every script you create should explicitly load input files and
explicitly save output files. finally, the output/ folder is where any
figures that you create using scripts reside.

Outside of these three folders I'll create the final analysis,
cherry-picking my favorite scripts and figures, adding a text
explanation to create a compelling data-driven story. README.md files
are useful for displaying your project in an easy to read manner on
github. These can easily be created from an R markdown analysis file.

#### R Markdown

R markdown documents are awesome! If you've never used an R Markdown
document before, check out Chapter 27 of Hadley Whickam's free book [R
for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It's a pretty quick read,
within 30 minutes you should be up and running with R Markdown. If you
need further assistance, refer to the [R Markdown
Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
by RStudio.

R markdown documents are great for exploratory data analysis because you
can quickly iterate through plot versions and easily keep notes on what
you're doing in the same document. Once you've found something that is
worth keeping, simply open up a new .R script copy and paste the
associated code (including the explicit load and save commands), and
move on to the next problem.

Once your done working through your project, open up a new .Rmd file and
glue together your best scripts with explanation text. Before you know
it, you'll have a summary document worthy of sharing! With the click of
a button, RStudio can 'knit' your R Markdown document into
github-flavored markdown, normal markdown, .html, .pdf, and more.

#### Blog Posts

If you’re interested in making blog posts from your analysis, just as I
do on this very site, R markdown is going to be your best friend. This
site is created using Jekyll, the static site generator. Read more about
Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is hosted for free on github
pages. Read more about github pages [here](https://pages.github.com/).

Once I've finished my analysis in R markdown, I knit the file into a
markdown (.md) document using the knitr library. To change your output
to .md, alter the YAML header of the R Markdown document to "output:
md\_document". Save and proceed to knit the document, and boom,
final\_analysis.md appears in your project directory along with its
associated images.q

Using your favorite code editor (mine is Visual Studio Code), copy the
markdown document into the posts/ directory of your websites blog, and
copy the associated images to the images/ directory. After a few minor
tweaks push a github commit and your blog will be updated with the new
post! Cool!

#### The Take Away

-   Use snake\_case when naming files and folders! <br  />
-   Use version control! <br  />
-   Never overwrite your original dataset! <br  />
-   Explicitly load inputs in your scripts! <br  />
-   Explicitly save outputs in your scripts! <br  />
-   Keep a project folder tidy with 3 sub-folders! <br  />
-   R Markdown is awesome, try it! <br  />
-   Making a blog is easier than you think (and free), try it! <br  />

That's all for now! 

Until next time, <br  /> - Fisher
