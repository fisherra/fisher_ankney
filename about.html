            Originally from rural Northern Michigan, I moved west a few days after graduating from high school.
        Today I enjoy spending as much time as I can in the mountains by fishing, hunting, hiking, skiing and camping.
        In the between, I've been able to jump start rewarding career in tech.

        I attended Colorado State University to earn a Bachelor's degree in Geophysics; studying geology and living in the
        Rocky Mountains made for a great undergraduate experience. Upon graduation in 2016, I spent two years working
        as a data analyst for the United States Geological Survey before taking off on a year-long backpacking trip around
        Asia, Europe and Central America.

        Returning to the US, I went back to school to earn a Master's degree in Statistics, then took my next job developing a novel forecasting
        algorithm for a small fuel pricing and optimization startup in May 2020. I naturally transitioned to product management at this startup,
        then signed on with Oracle, where I currently work on an advertising measurement solution.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        I have found it difficult to narrow down my focus to a single discipline - there is so much to learn about product management,
        software development, data science and engineering, business strategy and marketing, along with all the rest.
        That's where this site comes in; it allows me to explore all of these disciplines and report my findings! Thanks for reading!
