    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        Growing up in Grayling Michigan I was raised on a steady diet of hunting and fishing. My home town has a rich outdoors heritage, it is where legendary bow hunter Fred Bear opened up shop in 1933 and some 26 years later it is where Trout Unlimited was founded. Hell, even the ubiquitous Adam’s dry fly was invented just half an hour down the road on the Boardman River.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        My parents had me out in the field and stream since before I can remember, a service that I will forever be grateful for. I remember regularly wade fishing our favorite stretch of the Au Sable River just ten or fifteen minutes from our house nearly year round.

        Growing up, November 15th is a holy day for all in Northern Michigan. School would always be closed for this, the opening day of rifle season. I took my first whitetail with my bow from a tree stand in the woods behind the house at 13 and occasionally I still make the pilgrimage back to hunt whitetails in the north woods because there’s nothing quiet like it.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        I moved away from Michigan on the day after I graduated high school in 2011 to call Colorado home for the next decade as I focused on getting a career off the ground. Unfortunately I left most of my hunting and fishing behind while in Colorado, only taking the occasional day trip to fastly fish the nearby Poudre River. In early 2022 I decided I had enough of it and I moved to Boise - a city in a state to which I had never been before. Since the move I have been making the most out of every season in this bountiful new home.

<h2> Ronan - Australian Shepard </h2>

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        I got Ronan from a random guy on Facebook looking to offload his now grown puppy because he "didn’t have the time for him anymore" in 2021. Ronan was just over a year old and very poorly behaved. Our first six months together were rough, but we eventually established a good standard of canine citizenship. I am happy to say that Ronan has since turned into the best companion you could ask for, his heart and devotion makes up for any stubborn shortcomings that remain. 
    </p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        Ronan is at his best on the river. Always faithfully watching from the bank or from the back of the drift boat, he does the nymphing community a service by pulling out pesky sticks from the river's bottom. Ronan loves to hike and camp, requiring little supervision we often forget he's tagging along until he makes himself very conspicuous around snack time.

        Chase is my dad’s bird dog, he’s a handsome Brittany born in 2020. Chase cut his teeth on the flighty grouse and explosive woodcock of northern Michigan. Now days Chase regularly joins us on quail, pheasant and grouse hunts here in Idaho. He’s a cooperative dog with a good nose and strong retrieve, especially in the thicket. hase is always excited to get out and hunt, but he gets equally excited for his 7pm sharp bed time.

<h2> Coming Soon! - German Wirehaired Pointer </h2>

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        I’m excited to have put down a deposit on my very own GWP puppy. I expect to receive the dog in June of 2025, I’m planning to focus mainly on hunting the canyons for chukar and hun with my new partner.
