        Growing up in northern Michigan I was raised on a steady diet of hunting and fishing. My home town of Grayling boasts a rich outdoors heritage - it's where Fred Bear opened up shop in 1933 and 26 years later it's where Trout Unlimited was founded. Hell, even the ubiquitous Adam’s fly was invented just a few miles down the road on the Boardman River.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        My parents had me out in the field back before I can remember, a service that I will forever be grateful for. We would regularly fly fish our favorite stretch of the Au Sable just ten or fifteen minutes from our house nearly year round.

        November 15th is a holy day for all in Northern Michigan School would always be closed for this, the opening day of rifle season. I took my first whitetail with my bow from a tree stand in the woods behind the house at 13 and occasionally I still make the pilgrimage back to hunt whitetails in the north woods because there’s nothing quiet like it.

        On the day after I graduated high school I moved to Colorado, calling Fort Collins home for the next decade as I focused on getting an education and a career. Unfortunately I left most of my hunting and fishing behind during this time, only taking the occasional day trip to fish the overcroweded Poudre River. In early 2022 I decided I had enough of it and I moved to Boise - a city in a state to which I had never been before. Since the move I have been making the most out of every season in this bountiful new home.

<h2> Ronan - Australian Shepard </h2>
<br>

        I got Ronan from a random guy on Facebook looking to offload his now grown puppy because he "didn’t have the time for him anymore" in 2021. Ronan was just over a year old and very poorly behaved. Our first six months together were rough, but we eventually established a good standard of canine citizenship. I am happy to say that Ronan has since turned into the best companion you could ask for, his heart and devotion makes up for any stubborn shortcomings that remain. 
    </p> 
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        Ronan is at his best on the river. Always faithfully watching from the bank or from the back of the drift boat, he does the nymphing community a service by pulling out pesky sticks from the river's bottom. Ronan loves to hike and camp, requiring little supervision we often forget he's tagging along until he makes himself very conspicuous around snack time.

        I’m excited to have put down a deposit on my very own GWP puppy. I expect to receive the dog in June of 2025, I’m planning to focus mainly on hunting the chukar hills and the snake with my new canine partner.
