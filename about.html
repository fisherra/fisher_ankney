    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        Growing up in Grayling Michigan I was raised on a steady diet of hunting and fishing. My home town has a rich outdoors heritage, it is where legendary bow hunter Fred Bear opened up shop in 1933 and some 26 years later it is where Trout Unlimited was founded. Even the ubiquitous Adam’s dry fly was invented just half an hour down the road on the Boardman River.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        My parents had me out hunting and fishing from before I can remember, a service that I will forever be grateful for. I remember regularly wade fishing our favorite stretch of the Au Sable River just ten or fifteen minutes from our house nearly year round.

        November 15th is a holy day in Northern Michigan, school would always be closed for this, the opening day of rifle season. I took my first whitetail from a tree stand in the woods behind the house at 13 and occasionally I still make the pilgrimage back to hunt whitetails in the north woods because there’s nothing quiet like it.

        I moved away from Michigan on the day after I graduated high school in 2011, I would call Colorado home for the next decade as I focused on getting a career off the ground.  Unfortunately I left most of my hunting and fishing behind while in Colorado, only taking the occasional day trip to fish the nearby Poudre River.  In early 2022 I decided I had enough of it and I moved to Boise, a city in a state to which I had never been. Since the move I have been making the most out of every season in this bountiful new home.

<h2> Ronan - Australian Shepard </h2>

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        I got Ronan from a random guy on Facebook looking to offload his now grown puppy because he “didn’t have the time for him anymore” in 2021. Ronan was just over a year old and very poorly behaved. Our first six months together were rough, but we eventually established a good standard of canine citizenship in him. I am happy to say that Ronan has since turned into the best companion you could ask for, his heart more than make up for any shortcomings that remain.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
        Ronan is my best fishing buddy - always faithfully watching from the bank or from the back of the drift boat. He does the nymphing community a service by pulling out pesky sticks from river and carrying them about. Ronan loves to hike and camp, he is the definition of a velcro dog, requiring little supervision and checking in often. He has a strong distaste for duck hunting, I think it has something to do with his preference of a cozy bed over the freezing cold.

<h2> Chase - Brittany Spaniel </h2>

        Chase is my dad’s bird dog, he’s a handsome Brittany born in 2020. Chase cut his teeth on the grouse and woodcock of northern Michigan, now he regularly joins us on quail, pheasant and grouse hunts here in Idaho. He’s a very cooperative dog with a good nose and retrieve. Chase is always excited to get out and hunt, but he gets equally excited for his 7pm sharp bed time.     </p>

<h2> Coming Soon! - German Wirehaired Pointer </h2>

        I’m excited to have put down a deposit at Bone Point Kennels over in Oregon for my very own GWP puppy. I expect to receive the dog in June of 2025, I’m planning focus mainly on hunting the canyons for chukar and huns, but also to chase some waterfowl with my new partner.
