    <p style="font-size:1.1rem; text-indent:30px;">
            Originally from rural Northern Michigan, I moved west a few days after graduating from high school.
        Today I enjoy spending as much time as I can in the mountains by fishing, hunting, hiking, skiing and camping.
        In the between, I've been able to pursue a rewarding career in tech.
    </p> 

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        I attended Colorado State University to earn a Bachelor's degree in Geophysics; studying geology in the
        Rocky Mountains made for a great undergraduate experience. Upon graduation in 2016, I spent two years working
        as a data analyst for the United States Geological Survey before taking off on a year-long backpacking trip around
        Asia, Europe and Central America.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        Returning to the US, I went back to school to earn a Masters in Statistics. Upon gradation (again), I immediately joined a develope
        a novel fuel demand forecasting algorithm using my new stats/ML knowledge in May 2020. Very quickly my responsibilities transitioned away
        from ML engineering to product management, where I successfully drove the founder's vision for the product.

    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;">
        Wanting more exposure to mature product management processes, I joined Oracle in March 2022.
        I currently work on operational efficiency and self-service initiatives for Moat Analytics,
        a digital advertising campaign measurement and verification solution.
