<strong> R for Data Science - Hadley Wickham </strong>
<hr>

<p> 
    R for Data Science (R4DS) is available for <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">free</a> and is the definitive 
    guide to using R to conduct data science. I've purchased a hard copy because I found the content in R4DS to be absolutely 
    invaluable. R4DS takes you from knowing nothing about R to creating predictive models in 522 enjoyable, 
    informative, and engaging pages. If you can only read one about R, make this the one. 
</p>
<p><strong>Verdict - </strong><i style="color:green;" >Buy It</i></p>

<strong> Hands on Programming with R - Garrett Grolemund </strong> 
<hr>

<p> 
    Garret Grolemund co-authored R4DS, so it's no wonder that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Programming-Write-Functions-Simulations/dp/1449359019/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RQ3DSSGC8VHX626WSG6X">Hands on Programming with R</a>
    is top-notch. The book assumes no prior knowledge in R and walks you through three interesting projects. The projects focus on 
    programming in R, teaching you about environments, the object oriented S3 system, creating simulations, writing vectorized code,
    and a few other topics all in an applied setting. Definitely have a look at this book. 
</p>
<p><strong>Verdict - </strong><i style="color: orange;">Read It</i></p>

<strong> Statistics Using R - Sudha G. Purohit</strong> <br> 
<hr>

<p> 
    Printed in 2008, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Using-Sudha-G-Purohit/dp/1842654780">Statistics Using R</a > 
    features muddled instructions, poor formatting, out of date programming techniques, and half-explained theory.
    If I wasn't taking a probability course, I doubt I would be able to follow along the chaotic and assuming narrative of Statistics Using R.
    Don't waste your valuable time with this one.

<p><strong>Verdict - </strong><i style="color:red;">Skip It</i></p>
