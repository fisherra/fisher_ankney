<strong> R for Data Science - Hadley Wickham </strong>
<hr>

<p> 
        R for Data Science (R4DS) is available for <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">free</a> and is the definitive 
        guide to using R to conduct data science. I've purchased a hard copy because I found the content in R4DS to be absolutely 
        invaluable. R4DS takes you from knowing nothing about R to creating predictive models in 522 enjoyable, 
        informative, and engaging pages. If you can only read one about R, make this the one.

<strong> Hands on Programming with R - Garrett Grolemund </strong> 
<hr>

<p> 
        Garret Grolemund co-authored R4DS, so it's no wonder that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Programming-Write-Functions-Simulations/dp/1449359019/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=RQ3DSSGC8VHX626WSG6X">Hands on Programming with R</a>
        is top-notch. The book assumes no prior knowledge in R and walks you through three interesting projects. The projects focus on 
        programming in R, teaching you about environments, the object oriented S3 system, creating simulations, writing vectorized code,
        and a few other topics all in an applied setting. Definitely have a look at this book.

<strong> Statistics Using R - Sudha Purohit</strong> <br> 
<hr>

<p> 
        Printed in 2008, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistics-Using-Sudha-G-Purohit/dp/1842654780">Statistics Using R</a > 
        features muddled instructions, poor formatting, out of date programming techniques, and half-explained theory.
        If I wasn't taking a probability course, I doubt I would be able to follow along the chaotic and assuming narrative of Statistics Using R.
        Don't waste your valuable time with this one.

<strong> Learn Python the Hard Way - Zed Shaw</strong> <br> 
<hr>

<p> 
        Widely acclaimed, <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> provides a "from the beginning"
        introduction to general programming in python. Zed emphasized rote memorization and learning by repeatedly doing through a collection
        of 53 exercises and accompanying 'study drills'. There is an exponential curve in difficulty, as the first ~35 chapters
        are a bit boring and repetitive, while the last ~15 chapters are quite difficult and ill-explained. Personally, I would have preferred
        a more linear progression in difficulty, and don't care too much for the 'drill' style of learning.

<strong> Think Python - Allen Downey</strong> <br> 
<hr>

<p> 
     I really enjoyed working through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543594144&sr=8-2&keywords=think+python">Think Python</a>. 
     The 240-page text provides a compact introduction to general programming with Python. Note that there is 
     no discussion of data science packages, the book is simply an introduction to the language and foundational concepts. 
     With great prose, and a good mix of example code and explanation, Think Python is a must read for those without prior experience in Python. The second edition was released in 2015, so it is written in Python 3
     and is still highly relevant.
